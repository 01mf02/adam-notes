# Amsterdam notes

This is the research notebook for my project in Amsterdam.

2020-10-01
----------

A new life starts: Work in Amsterdam has started!
And I'm (de facto) in quarantine. Yay!
In order not to go crazy, I start my notes now.

For people reading this who are not me (hello, by the way):
My project is about improving the performance of nonclausal automated theorem provers.
(If that means nothing to you, you may still try to continue reading my notes.
I will probably not be too technical for now.)
In a nutshell, my project will cover a more theoretical and a more practical portion:
One will be to better *understand* nonclausal reasoning, and
the other will be to *apply* what we learnt in order to improve nonclausal reasoning.

I came back from Paris yesterday by car with some remaining stuff to move to Amsterdam.
As Paris is a red Covid-zone for the Dutch,
I will try to keep my social interactions to a minimum for the next days.
(Thanks to the Dutch for relying on common sense and cooperation
rather than strict measures.)

Today, I'm all alone, which means that this is perfect to get some work done.
As my host at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Jasmin Blanchette, is not here yet,
I have enjoyed my first work day at my cozy little apartment in Amstelveen
(except for when planes are flying over it).

So what did I do today?
I started by downloading and launching Isabelle2020 together with the newest AFP,
where <https://www.isa-afp.org/using.html> explains installation of the latter.
I then browsed some theories, in particular
[`Ordered_Resolution_Prover`](https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Ordered_Resolution_Prover.html).
To play with it:

This is part of [IsaFoL](https://bitbucket.org/isafol/isafol/wiki/Home), which is
a loose collection of projects to formalise logic in Isabelle, similarly to
[IsaFoR](http://cl-informatik.uibk.ac.at/software/ceta/).
One nuisance I encountered was to find out:
given an article, where to find its corresponding formalisation?

I also looked at
[`SATSolverVerification`](https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/SATSolverVerification.html),
which like `Ordered_Resolution_Prover`
also contains a formalisation of clauses, literals and so on.
Its author, Filip MariÄ‡, is not listed on the IsaFoL site, so
I suppose that this is an independent development.

The `Ordered_Resolution_Prover` seems to be quite nice and modular,
having also a rather clean-looking formalisation of substitution and Herbrand models.
Quite likely some parts will be useful for my project as well ...
The project seems to be documented in the article
"[Formalizing Bachmair and Ganzinger's Ordered Resolution Prover](http://matryoshka.gforge.inria.fr/pubs/rp_article.pdf)".

And now for something completely different.

I found a TPTP parser library for Rust, written by a certain
Michael Rawson from Manchester from who I had already heard a talk at AITP.
It turns out that he has already written a connection prover in Rust
(thus anticipating a pet project of mine),
and furthermore, he called it [lazyCoP](https://github.com/MichaelRawson/lazycop)
like I called one of my provers.
I tried it, but could not get it to terminate on the supplied problems,
whereas with some test problems from my provers, it worked just fine.
While Rawson's lazyCoP shares the name with my lazyCoP,
it is not about lazy list processing, but about lazy paramodulation,
which I would expect to be a solution to
leanCoP's suboptimal performance on problems involving equality.
Unfortunately, in CASC, Rawson's lazyCoP seems to not have performed too well yet.
I hope that it will become better ...

So far, my computer memory of 8GB seems to be sufficient,
but running Isabelle at the same time as some automated theorem prover
becomes a daunting task.
Luckily, the old me from 2015 was foresighted enough to equip my computer with a 8GB RAM stick
(the maximum size for a single stick supported by my computer),
leaving space for 8GB more.
So if 16GB turn out to be sufficient, it makes sense to upgrade my current computer
(instead of buying a completely new one).

That's it for today.
